[![N|Solid](https://automationpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/django-logo-negative.png?w=65)](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

## Project Description

CARINA is a web-based application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods, specifically multiclass text classification, to classify whether the structure of an abstract is correctly formatted. The application processes input abstracts and outputs a semi-structured abstract consisting of five key sections:

- **Background**
- **Objectives**
- **Methods**
- **Results**
- **Conclusions**

### Features

- **Abstract Classification**: Classifies abstracts into predefined labels: Background, Objectives, Methods, Results, and Conclusions.
- **Keyword Matching**: Checks for the presence of specific keywords in the abstract and highlights missing keywords.
- **Word Count Validation**: Ensures that the abstract doesn't exceed the word limit (450 words).
- **Interactive Interface**: Users can input their abstracts and get real-time feedback.
- **Copyable Result**: Users can easily copy the structured analysis result to the clipboard.

### Input

This project expects user to have 3 type of input from their abstract:
   - **Title**
   - **Abstract**
   - **Keywords**
